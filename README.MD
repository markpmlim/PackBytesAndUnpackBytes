This is a Swift playground project to demonstrate how to use the Swift version of the Apple IIgs Miscellanous Toolbox call packBytes and unpackBytes.

The first part of the main program shows how to encode a Super Hi-Res Screen Image file (SHR) to a Packed Super Hi-Res Image file (PAK).

The second part shows how to use the unpackBytes method to decode a PAK and write the resulting data to an SHR file.
